I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student from the [School of Optoelectronics](https://opt.bit.edu.cn/index.htm), [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://www.bit.edu.cn/). My research interests include optical tweezers, precision measurement, quantum measurement, and fiber sensing.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shangran Xie](https://opt.bit.edu.cn/jsdw/jsml/gdzyjs/60a0757348b144e2b5be2cb70ede3819.htm#:~:text=%E8%B0%A2%E5%B0%9A%E7%84%B6%EF%BC%8C%E5%9B%BD%E5%AE%B6%E7%BA%A7%E4%BA%BA%E6%89%8D%E8%AE%A1) of the [Laboratory of Optical Manipulation and Measurement Technology](http://sxielab.com/), School of Optoelectronics, Beijing Institute of Technology.
